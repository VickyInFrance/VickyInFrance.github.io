I have worked on many translations.  These include translating large and complex documents, often using highly technical and precise vocabulary such as in civil engineering projects, translating legal documents, company documents of all kinds, simultaneous live translations in court hearings and at the notary.

Pricing depends on the complexity of the translation and urgency, and also whether it is from written documents or live translations.  For written translations a quotation is based on the number of words in the document, the calculated time needed (particularly when extensive research may be required), and when time needs to be spent on customising English and turning ideas into the best marketing approach to reach customers.
