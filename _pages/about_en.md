We moved to France from London with our five young children in 1994.  In London we were owners and directors of various companies, in finance and also in wine, manufacturing and construction industries.  We were in search of a quieter life in which to bring up our children, however, by taking up a previous teaching diploma, I became an English teacher teaching all levels and ages.  For the last 17 years I’ve taught classes at the [University de Savoie](https://www.univ-smb.fr/en), which have included TOEIC preparation, and through kholles, or colles, in the Preparatory class (cram school) at [Lycée Berthollet](http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/lycee/berthollet.annecy/).  Since 2011 I’ve increased my teaching extensively in numerous companies and in doing translations, translating at solicitors' offices and live translations at court.  



Soon after moving to France, we set up a company and an in-house music recording studio (see our music website for residential possibilities for group practices and recordings).  My husband writes and plays music and is also a wonderful cook (go check out [Peter’s](GiezFoodie.github.io) daily cooking blog to see some of his exciting and trusted menus).


Our eldest son, Adam, also teaches the guitar, writes music and plays in concerts (see his [website](http://www.adamnaylormusic.com/) for more information). 


Since living in France we have become involved in many aspects of the community, including two successive mandates as an elected council member of our home town.  We have also obtained dual nationality; English and French.
