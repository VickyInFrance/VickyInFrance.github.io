"*Vicky has been preparing my students from scientific preparatory classes for their oral exams for the entrance exams to the engineering grandes écoles for several years at the Lycée C. L.

"*I highly recommend Vicky's English courses; they are lively and constructive and can be adapted to each level in native English.
I have had these English courses deployed for the last 3 years for the staff of my factory (from the technician to the manager), according to different formulas i.e. by telephone, in groups or one-to-one.
I have been able to quickly see clear progress in my teams.*"

"*Vicky Naylor is an absolutely remarkable teacher. Her kindness, her sense of pedagogy, her enthusiasm and her determination have enabled our two children to acquire the fundamentals of oral and written English while discovering English culture and literature. Now aged 13 and 10, they are excited to be able to choose English reading material - from Harry Potter to the Famous Five. Vicky is a person not to be missed!*"

"It was a real pleasure to take English lessons with Vicky. As an employee, my private lessons were financed by my CPF (personal training account) and a supplement from my employer. For 4 years I had 1 hours and half of lessons per week at my workplace. I was surprised and pleased with the progress I made. I started with a low school level and ended up with a good level to converse in English in foreign countries. The lessons were face to face, ideal for exchanging without embarrassment and we covered all sorts of topics: current affairs, professional activities, sport, cooking, education, holidays ... We revised the grammar with the conjugation times which are so important for good communication. The rhythm is adapted to each learner. In order to become familiar with English Vicky advised me to watch films in English and to translate selected texts in order to have more vocabulary. Every week was a pleasant experience... Our laughter can attest to this. I can only recommend Vicky who is a good person, very kind and positive. We have become friends. Thank you Vicky!"

"*I have had the pleasure of working with Vicky for 5 years as an English teacher at the Institut d'Administration des Entreprises (IAE, Université Savoie Mont-Blanc) in Annecy. Together we also offered khôlles at the Lycée Berthollet for preparatory students. I greatly appreciate her human and professional qualities: pleasant, attentive, open, available, always very competent and concerned about the students' success. Thank you very much Vicky for this successful collaboration!*"

"*Vicky has been with our company for over 7 years.*

*Depending on everyone's availability, Vicky has worked between 6 and 12 hours a week.  She has helped all IOA employees to progress in both spoken and written English, either face to face at the Head Office or via Skype with our employees at our other sites in France and overseas.*

*She has also helped our company with the translation into English of various highly technical documents (technical specifications, standards, contracts, calls for tenders, etc.), but also with our various communication tools (presentation brochures, website, etc.).*

*It is always with great pleasure that we look forward to our turn to have a lesson with Vicky every week.  It is a very pleasant moment and at the same time we are making progress. 

*As the levels are very different from person to person, for some people she had to start from scratch and for others she helped them to practice their already established command of the language.  

*Thanks to her lessons we have been able to build up our confidence in speaking English.*"

"*I met Vicky in a professional context by taking English courses offered by the company where I worked. I appreciate her smile, her good humour, her kindness, the sincere interest Vicky shows in people. I immediately felt at ease with her, which for me is essential to learning a language in good conditions. Her great experience in teaching and her open-mindedness make her lessons lively, interesting and useful. Don't hesitate to call on Vicky to help you improve your English.*"

"*In early 2005 my cousin Charles Snook disappeared from a house in the foothills of the Alps near Annecy in France.  He has never reappeared.  
Charles’s immediate family hailed from Zimbabwe and like him they had moved away from Africa and at the time were based in Canada and South Africa.  So, the family had a problem.  There were numerous legal and logistical requirements that needed to be fulfilled, all in a foreign language with the family scattered and operating in different time zones.  Vicky Naylor stepped in to help.
Vicky was appointed as Charles’s legal representative and without her help we would never have got to a position where we now have some sort of closure.  
Initially Vicky helped us deal with the immediate issues of dealing with the police to try and ensure that no stone had been left unturned in their investigation into the disappearance.  We then needed to deal with his possessions including selling his car and transferring the money to his bank account.  Vicky even helped us find and plant a tree at Charles’s favourite hang-gliding spot where we held a small remembrance vigil for him.
We then had all the legal niceties to deal with.  We had appointed a lawyer but without Vicky’s on-going help and determination we would not have got to the position where the French Court finally declared that Charles be deemed as missing and that his affairs could be wound up.  Vicky helped us understand the workings of the French Courts and Law.  This involved on-going discussions with the lawyer, attending court, liaising with notaries and Charles’s bank and placing notices in French newspapers.  
None of this was easy and Vicky regularly took time off her usual work routines to fulfil these activities.  Her calm and determined manner was invaluable against a background of a sometimes highly emotive and stressed immediate family.
I would not want to have to go through something like this again but if anyone needs the help of an efficient and scrupulously decent individual I would be delighted to recommend her.*"
