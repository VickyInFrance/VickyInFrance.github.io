From half hourly lessons by telephone for the beginner, to hourly telephone lessons for the more advanced.  I will send you supporting lessons for you to study, keep and prepare, or for us to work together. I work at your speed and to your learning.

We can always find a convenient time to work around your schedule with a week's notice.

For children up to 7 years of age, I use music with songs, actions and play.  The older the child gets, this strategy continues but increasingly includes constructive learning by means of building blocks for grammar and writing skills.

You are never too young or too old to learn English.
